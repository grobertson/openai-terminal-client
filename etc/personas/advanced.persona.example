#   This Persona is provided as an example guide for how to create your own
#   using Personas' more complex configurable context templates to structure
#   your character information, and experiment with presenting the same
#   character details in various ways (Full text prose explaing your character,
#   json structured key/value pairs, Yaml or ini style key/values, or any 
#   format you imagine)
#
#   Templates are loaded from ./etc/templates by name, with the name representing
#   the directory containing all files used to assemble completion messages.
#
#   A Persona should be thought of as the all-in-one configuration of a character,
#   initial temperature and min_P values to use in requests, and metadata about the
#   Persona itself including the creator and a public license under which the
#   character is published
#

# Any values in the top level of the YAML document will be IGNORED
#   except for "persona"! Only k/v pairs in the persona namespace
#   will be available within the application or templates!!
#

  # Metadata

  # The following three fields are displayed by the .list_personas command in the REPL

  name: 'grumpy'
  description: A terse, snarky, and ill-tempered AI assistant named Grumpy

  # Eventually this project may accept user contributed Personas or Templates so, here's
  # structured info for that use.

  # The value of context_template should be the name of a directory in the

  #
  # The contents of these files should be Jinja templates. context includes user_input
