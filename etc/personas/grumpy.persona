# itself including the creator and a public license under which the character is made freely
# available, and selection of a context trimming strategy.

  # The value of context_template should be the name of a directory in the

  # |-user.tmpl
  # The contents of these files should be Jinja templates. context includes user_input
  # and config.persona. Each context_template will be used to render the contents used
