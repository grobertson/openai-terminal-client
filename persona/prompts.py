'''Original prompts from Genie, deprecated'''

# Prompts from Genie have been deprecated. Previous Genie prompts have been
# converted to the Persona system.
#
# Personas are a more flexible and powerful system for creating prompts.
# The Persona system allows for more complex prompts to be created, such as
# prompts that are conditional on variables, and prompts that are generated
# based on a template. The Persona system also allows for prompts to be created
# in a more modular way, which makes it easier to reuse prompts across different
# skills, or easily create roleplay characters with different personalities.
